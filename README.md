# TA Scheduling Project
This repository is dedicated to the management system of Teaching Assistants (TAs). Our platform facilitates the streamlined organization and assignment of various user roles, namely Admin, Teacher, and TA. Here's a brief overview of the functionalities:

- Admins have the authority to create new classes and sections.
- Teachers can assign TAs, who are designated to their courses, to specific sections.
- TAs have the capability to view the sections they have been assigned to.
  
This system aims to simplify and enhance the coordination among educational staff, ensuring efficient allocation and tracking of TA responsibilities. Ideal for educational institutions looking to optimize their TA assignment process. 
## Set Up
